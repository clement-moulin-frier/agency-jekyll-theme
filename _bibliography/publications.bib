abstract = {This paper introduces a cognitive architecture for a humanoid robot to engage in a proactive, mixed-initiative exploration and manipulation of its environment, where the initiative can originate from both the human and the robot. The framework, based on a biologically-grounded theory of the brain and mind, integrates a reactive interaction engine, a number of state-of-the art perceptual and motor learning algorithms, as well as planning abilities and an autobiographical memory. The architecture as a whole drives the robot behavior to solve the symbol grounding problem, acquire language capabilities, execute goal-oriented behavior, and express a verbal narrative of its own experience in the world. We validate our approach in a human-robot interaction experiment with the iCub humanoid robot, showing that the proposed cognitive architecture can be applied in real time within a realistic scenario.},

title = {{Emergent Jaw Predominance in Vocal Development through Stochastic Optimization}},
abstract = {Infant vocal babbling strongly relies on jaw oscillations, especially at the stage of canonical babbling, which underlies the syllabic structure of world languages. In this paper, we propose, model and analyze an hypothesis to explain this predominance of the jaw in early babbling. This hypothesis states that general stochastic optimization principles, when applied to learning sensorimotor control, automatically generate ordered babbling stages with a predominant exploration of jaw movements in early stages. The reason is that those movements impact the auditory effects more than other articulators. In previous computational models, such general principles were shown to selectively freeze and free degrees of freedom in a model reproducing the proximo-distal development observed in infant arm reaching. The contribution of this paper is to show how, using the same methods, we are able to explain such patterns in vocal development. We present three experiments. The two first ones show that the recruitment order of articulators emerging from stochastic optimization depends on the target sound to be achieved but that on average the jaw is largely chosen as the first recruited articulator. The third experiment analyses in more detail how the emerging recruitment order is shaped by the dynamics of the optimization process.},

abstract = {Abstract:
This work introduces new results on the modeling of early-vocal development using artificial intelligent cognitive architectures and a simulated vocal tract. The problem is addressed using intrinsically-motivated learning algorithms for autonomous sensorimotor exploration, a kind of algorithm belonging to the active learning architectures family. The artificial agent is able to autonomously select goals to explore its own sensorimotor system in regions where its competence to execute intended goals is improved. We propose to include a somatosensory system to provide a proprioceptive feedback signal to reinforce learning through the autonomous discovery of motor constraints. Constraints are represented by a somatosensory model which is unknown beforehand to the learner. Both the sensorimotor and somatosensory system are modeled using Gaussian mixture models. We argue that using an architecture which includes a somatosensory model would reduce redundancy in the sensorimotor model and drive the learning process more efficiently than algorithms taking into account only auditory feedback. The role of this proposed system is to predict whether an undesired collision within the vocal tract under a certain motor configuration is likely to occur. Thus, compromised motor configurations are rejected, guaranteeing that the agent is less prone to violate its own constraints.},

We investigate this question in the framework of the "Distributed Adaptive Control" (DAC) cognitive architecture, where we study top-down and bottom-up interactions between low-level reactive control and symbolic rule learning in embodied agents. Reactive behaviors are modeled using a neural allostatic controller, whereas high-level behaviors are modeled using a biologically-grounded memory network reflecting the role of the prefrontal cortex. The interaction of these modules in a closed-loop fashion suggests how symbolic representations might have been shaped from low-level behaviors and recruited for behavior optimization.},

  Abstract                 = {We provide a computational model showing how turn-taking behaviors can self-organize out of sensorimotor interactions between vocalizing agents. Recent hypotheses propose that turn-taking behaviors in certain primate species emerge from a need to maintain vocal contact in a group (e.g. in dense environments preventing visual contact). In this context, vocalizations can convey information about the presence of each group member and taking turns allow to minimize the vocal signal interferences. We consider agents equipped with a cognitive architecture based on two coupled control loops: a reactive one implementing a basic regulatory behavior to maintain vocal listening and an adaptive one learning an action policy to maximize vocal contact among group members. We show that the reactive process bootstraps the adaptive learning to converge toward a collective turn-taking strategy. This model provides a computational support to the hypothesis that turn-taking can emerge from functional constraints related to group cohesion and inter-individual vocal signal interferences. We suggest future directions of research to understand how social behaviors can result from sensorimotor interactions.}

  Abstract                 = {This article presents a model of the control of hand movements learned from human imprecise feedback. The setup consists of an iCub humanoid robot able to paint with a pencil on an interactive display. It learns to avoid an abstract boundary, which is drawn on the table and that the robot can perceive. Before learning, the robot does not know that it has to paint only inside the boundary. This is instead learned from human feedback provided whenever the pencil goes outside of the shape. We use a neurocomputational model of the cerebellum, which learns to anticipate the human feedback from the perception of the previously meaningless shape boundaries. We show how this biologically-grounded adaptive mechanism, which is plausible in terms of human infant development, allows the learning of a precise painting behavior, using the perception of the shape boundaries as a predictive signal of aversive stimuli. This mechanism can be generalized to any kind of task where some aversive feedback can be considered correlated with available sensory cues. Consequently, the model allows a human teaching to a robot any kind of complex task, as long as the human knows how to provide consistent feedback and the robot has available the sufficient sensory cues. This becomes specially relevant for educating a robot on social behaviour or bringing it to a socially rich environment.}

homeostatic social drives, or needs. Homeostatic drives define a comfort zone (CZ) within a range of sensory data, and elicit reactive actions when outside of the CZ. These needs are related to physical and speech interactions and are modeled as a set of decaying dynamical systems. For example, the need for speech interaction increases with time as long as the robot does not perceive any speech sound from the human.  Out of its comfort zone, the reactive actions are synthesized speech sentences and body movements supposed to attract the attention of the human. On top of these reactive homeostatic regulators, an adaptive controller learns from experience how to anticipate actions to avoid the crossing of the comfort zone boundaries. This anticipation is learned from a neurocomputational model of the cerebellum. We show how these mechanisms allow the robot to learn the appropriate timing of its own actions with respect to 
those of the human in order to maintain the social interaction over the time. }

Languages, despite their wide variety, display obvious regularities. In this paper, we attempt to derive some properties of phonological systems (the sound systems for human languages) from speech communication principles. We introduce a model of the cognitive architecture of a communicating agent, called COSMO (for ``Communicating about Objects using Sensory–Motor Operations``) that allows a probabilistic expression of the main theoretical trends found in the speech production and perception literature. This enables a computational comparison of these theoretical trends, which helps us to identify the conditions that favor the emergence of linguistic codes. We present realistic simulations of phonological system emergence showing that COSMO is able to predict the main regularities in vowel, stop consonant and syllable systems in human languages.}

Focusing on speech perception, we demonstrate that under two hypotheses, regarding communication noise and inter-speaker variability, providing per-fect conditions for speech communication, motor and auditory theories are indistinguishable. We then degrade successively each hypothesis to study the distinguishability of the different theories in "adverse" conditions. We first present simulations on a simplified implementation of the model with mono-dimensional sensory and motor variables, and secondly we consider a simula-tion of the human vocal tract providing more realistic auditory and articula-tory variables.

We propose and experimentally test the hypothesis that general mechanisms of intrinsically motivated spontaneous exploration, also called curiosity-driven learning, can self-organize developmental stages during early vocal learning. We introduce a computational model of intrinsically motivated vocal exploration, which allows the learner to autonomously structure its own vocal experiments, and thus its own learning schedule, through a drive to maximize competence progress. This model relies on a physical model of the vocal tract, the auditory system and the agent's motor control as well as vocalizations of social peers. We present computational experiments that show how such a mechanism can explain the adaptive transition from vocal self-exploration with little influence from the speech environment, to a later stage where vocal exploration becomes influenced by vocalizations of peers. Within the initial self-exploration phase, we show that a sequence of vocal production stages self-organizes, and shares properties with data from infant developmental psychology: the vocal learner first discovers how to control phonation, then focuses on vocal variations of unarticulated sounds, and finally automatically discovers and focuses on babbling with articulated proto-syllables. As the vocal learner becomes more proficient at producing complex sounds, imitating vocalizations of peers starts to provide high learning progress explaining an automatic shift from self-exploration to vocal imitation.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a probabilistic framework unifying two important families of exploration mechanisms recently shown to be efficient to learn complex non-linear redundant sensorimotor mappings. These two explorations mechanisms are: 1) goal babbling, 2) active learning driven by the maximization of empirically measured learning progress. We show how this generic framework allows to model several recent algorithmic architectures for exploration. Then, we propose a particular implementation using Gaussian Mixture Models, which at the same time provides an original empirical measure of the competence progress. Finally, we perform computer simulations on two simulated setups: the control of the end effector of a 7-DoF arm and the control of the formants produced by an articulatory synthesizer.},

Phonetic learning refers here to learning how to control a vocal tract to reach acoustic goals. We compare three different exploration strategies for learning the auditory-motor inverse model: random motor exploration, random goal selection with reaching, and curiositydriven active goal selection with reaching. Using a realistic vocal tract model, we show how intrinsically motivated learning driven by competence progress can generate automatically developmental structure in both articulatory and auditory modalities, displaying patterns in line with some experimental data from infants.},

This issue concerns multiple and diverse fields such as engineering, economics, artificial intelligence, cognitive science and many others. Basically, an agent has to choose a single or series of actions from a set of options, without knowing for sure their consequences. Schematically, two main approaches have been followed: either the agent learns which option is the correct one to choose in a given situation by trial and error, or the agent already has some knowledge on the possible consequences of his decisions; this knowledge being generally expressed as a conditional probability distribution. In the latter case, several optimal or suboptimal methods have been proposed to exploit this uncertain knowledge in various contexts. In this work, we propose following a different approach, based on the geometric intuition of distance. More precisely, we define a goal independent quasimetric structure on the state space, taking into account both cost function and transition probability. We then compare precision and computation time with classical approaches.}},
