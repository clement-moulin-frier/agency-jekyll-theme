  Abstract                 = {{In this paper, we put forward a computational framework for the comparison between motor, auditory and perceptuo-motor theories of speech communi-cation. We first recall the basic arguments of these three sets of theories, ei-ther applied to speech perception or to speech production. Then we expose a unifying Bayesian model able to express each theory in a probabilistic way. Focusing on speech perception, we demonstrate that under two hypotheses, regarding communication noise and inter-speaker variability, providing per-fect conditions for speech communication, motor and auditory theories are indistinguishable. We then degrade successively each hypothesis to study the distinguishability of the different theories in "adverse" conditions. We first present simulations on a simplified implementation of the model with mono-dimensional sensory and motor variables, and secondly we consider a simula-tion of the human vocal tract providing more realistic auditory and articula-tory variables. Simulation results allow us to emphasize the respective roles of motor and auditory knowledge in various conditions of speech perception in adverse conditions, and to suggest some guidelines for future studies aiming at assessing the role of motor knowledge in speech perception.}},

  Abstract                 = {We bridge the gap between two issues in infant development: vocal development and intrinsic motivation. We propose and experimentally test the hypothesis that general mechanisms of intrinsically motivated spontaneous exploration, also called curiosity-driven learning, can self-organize developmental stages during early vocal learning. We introduce a computational model of intrinsically motivated vocal exploration, which allows the learner to autonomously structure its own vocal experiments, and thus its own learning schedule, through a drive to maximize competence progress. This model relies on a physical model of the vocal tract, the auditory system and the agent's motor control as well as vocalizations of social peers. We present computational experiments that show how such a mechanism can explain the adaptive transition from vocal self-exploration with little influence from the speech environment, to a later stage where vocal exploration becomes influenced by vocalizations of peers. Within the initial self-exploration phase, we show that a sequence of vocal production stages self-organizes, and shares properties with data from infant developmental psychology: the vocal learner first discovers how to control phonation, then focuses on vocal variations of unarticulated sounds, and finally automatically discovers and focuses on babbling with articulated proto-syllables. As the vocal learner becomes more proficient at producing complex sounds, imitating vocalizations of peers starts to provide high learning progress explaining an automatic shift from self-exploration to vocal imitation.},

We show how this generic framework allows to model several recent algorithmic architectures for exploration. Then, we propose a particular implementation using Gaussian Mixture Models, which at the same time provides an original empirical measure of the competence progress. Finally, we perform computer simulations on two simulated setups: the control of the end effector of a 7-DoF arm and the control of the formants produced by an articulatory synthesizer.},

This issue concerns multiple and diverse fields such as engineering, economics, artificial intelligence, cognitive science and many others. Basically, an agent has to choose a single or series of actions from a set of options, without knowing for sure their consequences. Schematically, two main approaches have been followed: either the agent learns which option is the correct one to choose in a given situation by trial and error, or the agent already has some knowledge on the possible consequences of his decisions; this knowledge being generally expressed as a conditional probability distribution. In the latter case, several optimal or suboptimal methods have been proposed to exploit this uncertain knowledge in various contexts. In this work, we propose following a different approach, based on the geometric intuition of distance. More precisely, we define a goal independent quasimetric structure on the state space, taking into account both cost function and transition probability. We then compare precision and computation time with classical approaches.}},
