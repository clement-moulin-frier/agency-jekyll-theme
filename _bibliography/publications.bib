  Abstract                 = {We provide a computational model showing how turn-taking behaviors can self-organize out of sensorimotor interactions between vocalizing agents. Recent hypotheses propose that turn-taking behaviors in certain primate species emerge from a need to maintain vocal contact in a group (e.g. in dense environments preventing visual contact). In this context, vocalizations can convey information about the presence of each group member and taking turns allow to minimize the vocal signal interferences. We consider agents equipped with a cognitive architecture based on two coupled control loops: a reactive one implementing a basic regulatory behavior to maintain vocal listening and an adaptive one learning an action policy to maximize vocal contact among group members. We show that the reactive process bootstraps the adaptive learning to converge toward a collective turn-taking strategy. This model provides a computational support to the hypothesis that turn-taking can emerge from functional constraints related to group cohesion and inter-individual vocal signal interferences. We suggest future directions of research to understand how social behaviors can result from sensorimotor interactions.}

  Abstract                 = {This article presents a model of the control of hand movements learned from human imprecise feedback. The setup consists of an iCub humanoid robot able to paint with a pencil on an interactive display. It learns to avoid an abstract boundary, which is drawn on the table and that the robot can perceive. Before learning, the robot does not know that it has to paint only inside the boundary. This is instead learned from human feedback provided whenever the pencil goes outside of the shape. We use a neurocomputational model of the cerebellum, which learns to anticipate the human feedback from the perception of the previously meaningless shape boundaries. We show how this biologically-grounded adaptive mechanism, which is plausible in terms of human infant development, allows the learning of a precise painting behavior, using the perception of the shape boundaries as a predictive signal of aversive stimuli. This mechanism can be generalized to any kind of task where some aversive feedback can be considered correlated with available sensory cues. Consequently, the model allows a human teaching to a robot any kind of complex task, as long as the human knows how to provide consistent feedback and the robot has available the sufficient sensory cues. This becomes specially relevant for educating a robot on social behaviour or bringing it to a socially rich environment.}

  Abstract                 = {We propose a model integrating a reactive and an adaptive control loops for social learning in the context of human­robot interaction. We equip a humanoid iCub robot with a set of 
homeostatic social drives, or needs. Homeostatic drives define a comfort zone (CZ) within a range of sensory data, and elicit reactive actions when outside of the CZ. These needs are related to physical and speech interactions and are modeled as a set of decaying dynamical systems. For example, the need for speech interaction increases with time as long as the robot does not perceive any speech sound from the human.  Out of its comfort zone, the reactive actions are synthesized speech sentences and body movements supposed to attract the attention of the human. On top of these reactive homeostatic regulators, an adaptive controller learns from experience how to anticipate actions to avoid the crossing of the comfort zone boundaries. This anticipation is learned from a neurocomputational model of the cerebellum. We show how these mechanisms allow the robot to learn the appropriate timing of its own actions with respect to 
those of the human in order to maintain the social interaction over the time. }

  Abstract                 = {While the origin of language remains a somewhat mysterious process, understanding how human language takes specific forms appears to be accessible by the experimental method. Languages, despite their wide variety, display obvious regularities. In this paper, we attempt to derive some properties of phonological systems (the sound systems for human languages) from speech communication principles. We introduce a model of the cognitive architecture of a communicating agent, called COSMO (for ``Communicating about Objects using Sensory–Motor Operations``) that allows a probabilistic expression of the main theoretical trends found in the speech production and perception literature. This enables a computational comparison of these theoretical trends, which helps us to identify the conditions that favor the emergence of linguistic codes. We present realistic simulations of phonological system emergence showing that COSMO is able to predict the main regularities in vowel, stop consonant and syllable systems in human languages.}

Then we expose a unifying Bayesian model able to express each theory in a probabilistic way. Focusing on speech perception, we demonstrate that under two hypotheses, regarding communication noise and inter-speaker variability, providing per-fect conditions for speech communication, motor and auditory theories are indistinguishable. We then degrade successively each hypothesis to study the distinguishability of the different theories in "adverse" conditions. We first present simulations on a simplified implementation of the model with mono-dimensional sensory and motor variables, and secondly we consider a simula-tion of the human vocal tract providing more realistic auditory and articula-tory variables. Simulation results allow us to emphasize the respective roles of motor and auditory knowledge in various conditions of speech perception in adverse conditions, and to suggest some guidelines for future studies aiming at assessing the role of motor knowledge in speech perception.}},

We propose and experimentally test the hypothesis that general mechanisms of intrinsically motivated spontaneous exploration, also called curiosity-driven learning, can self-organize developmental stages during early vocal learning. We introduce a computational model of intrinsically motivated vocal exploration, which allows the learner to autonomously structure its own vocal experiments, and thus its own learning schedule, through a drive to maximize competence progress. This model relies on a physical model of the vocal tract, the auditory system and the agent's motor control as well as vocalizations of social peers. We present computational experiments that show how such a mechanism can explain the adaptive transition from vocal self-exploration with little influence from the speech environment, to a later stage where vocal exploration becomes influenced by vocalizations of peers. Within the initial self-exploration phase, we show that a sequence of vocal production stages self-organizes, and shares properties with data from infant developmental psychology: the vocal learner first discovers how to control phonation, then focuses on vocal variations of unarticulated sounds, and finally automatically discovers and focuses on babbling with articulated proto-syllables. As the vocal learner becomes more proficient at producing complex sounds, imitating vocalizations of peers starts to provide high learning progress explaining an automatic shift from self-exploration to vocal imitation.},

  Abstract                 = {Based on a review of models and theories in speech communication, this paper proposes an original Bayesian framework able to express each of them in a unified way. This framework allows to selectively incorporate motor processes in perception or auditory representations in production, thus implementing components of a perceptuo-motor link in speech communication processes. This provides a basis for future computational works on the joint study of perception, production and their coupling in speech communication.},

  Abstract                 = {Starting from language origins theories, which connect prelinguistic primate abilities such as deixis, to modern linguistic systems, we seek to let emerge universals of human languages such as dispersion principles and the quantal aspect of speech. For this aim, we model a society of Bayesian sensory-motor agents, which interact and evolve in an environment filled with objects they can identify. We show how these agents may converge on a common phonological code for communication. This enables us to validate our assumptions and suggest probabilistic models of language origins {theories.ISSP}},

  Abstract                 = {{We propose a new approach for solving a class of discrete decision making problems under uncertainty with positive cost. This issue concerns multiple and diverse fields such as engineering, economics, artificial intelligence, cognitive science and many others. Basically, an agent has to choose a single or series of actions from a set of options, without knowing for sure their consequences. Schematically, two main approaches have been followed: either the agent learns which option is the correct one to choose in a given situation by trial and error, or the agent already has some knowledge on the possible consequences of his decisions; this knowledge being generally expressed as a conditional probability distribution. In the latter case, several optimal or suboptimal methods have been proposed to exploit this uncertain knowledge in various contexts. In this work, we propose following a different approach, based on the geometric intuition of distance. More precisely, we define a goal independent quasimetric structure on the state space, taking into account both cost function and transition probability. We then compare precision and computation time with classical approaches.}},
