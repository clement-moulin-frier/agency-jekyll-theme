# Real-Time Interaction course

## CSIM Master, 2016-2017

You will find on this page all the material related to the Real-Time Interaction course.

### General information about the course
- [Course presentation document](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18Dwo_TU-fEMYThNJh4NZCLkp7n9jb58RV_UXWCb95DI/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Evaluation process](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P-R1E_EHBr9nHd4QVID_EsNc5alW37uCtYy6bv0NXBk/edit?usp=sharing)
- The slides of the theoretical sessions are provided in two formats
    + An interactive web version (the same as in class). It is recommended to open it in [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox) (some graphic problems have been observed when using Chrome). Note that it doesn't directly embbed the videos, they are replaced by clickable links instead.
    + A PDF version, to be used if you have trouble with the web version or if you want to store the document on your own computer in a more standard way.
- The instructions for the practical sessions are available on [Github](https://github.com/clement-moulin-frier/pyvrep_epuck). Those instructions are adapted for the classroom computers, but everything can in theory be installed on your own machines (ask if needed).

### Week 1: Introduction to RTI (Theoretical Class 1)

- Link to the slides: [[Interactive web version](https://cdn.rawgit.com/clement-moulin-frier/rti_course/master/class_1/intro.sozi.html)]. [[PDF version]({{site.url}}/media/rti_course/rti_intro.pdf)]. 
    - It is recommended to read the interactive web version in [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox) (some display problems observed when using Chrome). Note that it doesn't directly embbed the videos, they are replaced by clickable links instead.
    - If you prefer storing the document on your own computer in a more standard way, use the PDF version above.

### Week 2: First steps with the robotic simulator (Practical Class 1)

- [Link to the instructions](https://github.com/clement-moulin-frier/pyvrep_epuck) we used in class
- I'm in touch with UPF so that we can have everything already installed in the classroom, in order to avoid having to repeat all the downloads at each session. I'll let you know when it is done.
- All the software components are cross-platform, so you can in theory install everything on your own computer whatever your OS is. You will have to install:
    - The [V-REP simulator](http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads.html) (choose the `PRO EDU` version for you OS).
    - A working Python distribution (on Windows the standard one is called [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)).
    - The [Pypot library](https://github.com/clement-moulin-frier/pypot).
    - The [`pyvrep_epuck` library](https://github.com/clement-moulin-frier/pyvrep_epuck) I have written for the course


### Week 3: Top-down and Bottom-up Cognitive Architectures (Theoretical Class 2)
- Link to the slides: [[Interactive web version](https://cdn.rawgit.com/clement-moulin-frier/rti_course/master/class_2/week2.sozi.html)]. [[PDF version]({{site.url}}/media/rti_course/class2.pdf)].
